# i310dheart

**Project Goal**: Create an ML model that accurately predicts the survival rate of heart failure patients.

**Dataset**: 
- Source: Kaggle's heart failure dataset
- Description: Contains biometric data of patients who have experienced heart failure
- Features: Anemia, age, diabetes, smoking status, and relevant clinical indicators

**Methodology**: 
- Train an ML model with 80% of the data and test with the remaining 20%
- Visualizing data with various different graphs

**Getting Started**: 
- Clone the repository
- Download the Kaggle heart failure dataset
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, etc)
- Split the data (80% train, 20% test)
- Train the ML model
- Evaluate and visualize the results
